"""At least three of the Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan on Wednesday have been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to Japan’s health ministry.

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

Two flights have repatriated over 400 Japanese citizens from Wuhan on Wednesday and Thursday mornings local time.""

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it. The flu kills hundreds of thousands a year. I'm not saying we shouldn't stop/lower efforts to contain the coronavirus but to think that failure to do so would lead to the apocalypse is just misinformed

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"I still absolutely think this will crash. I’m not willing to put my life savings on it, but it is inevitable. They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.
Whew... that's a lot of holding. Best of luck to you on the spce calls. I did puts on it a few days ago cashed out at 32% up. But my FB calls today really hurt. Time heals all wounds they say. 🤪

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it.

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it.

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"No shit that's what smart &amp; dumb money is, retard, but that's not what the argument is and you know it.  That's why you're fucking dodging it.

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

Two flights have repatriated over 400 Japanese citizens from Wuhan on Wednesday and Thursday mornings local time.""

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."
"Sorry but, it's looking like msft will open red tbh

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"I still absolutely think this will crash. I’m not willing to put my life savings on it, but it is inevitable. They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

"There's really no way you could have lost money on tesla. Yesterday, Elon tweeted a chair emoji. This indicates that earnings are something the shorts should have a seat for before viewing.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"""At least three of the Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan on Wednesday have been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to Japan’s health ministry.

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

Two flights have repatriated over 400 Japanese citizens from Wuhan on Wednesday and Thursday mornings local time.""

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Now you should get a pass on this one if you’re under 9 yrs old. Right?
Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it. The flu kills hundreds of thousands a year. I'm not saying we shouldn't stop/lower efforts to contain the coronavirus but to think that failure to do so would lead to the apocalypse is just misinformed

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.
Whew... that's a lot of holding. Best of luck to you on the spce calls. I did puts on it a few days ago cashed out at 32% up. But my FB calls today really hurt. Time heals all wounds they say. 🤪

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."
"Sorry but, it's looking like msft will open red tbh

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

"There's really no way you could have lost money on tesla. Yesterday, Elon tweeted a chair emoji. This indicates that earnings are something the shorts should have a seat for before viewing.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse?

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Not only does the Cybertruck have a much larger lockable internal bed volume than the F-150, but it also has a frunk compartment and two huge 6 foot long side sail panels for tools. 

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

Hope there's a dip soon. I want in
"You too can become wealthy just the way I did - marry a doctor. 😁😁😁

I have a good career but I enjoy telling people I’m a trophy husband."
"Tesla's IV before the earnings was 10% so unless the stock moves up at least 10%, calls will be eaten by IV crash. Puts are dead regardless."
"at open? maybe if theres enough selling to take profit, wouldn't bet on it though"
"How can you price in an election that no one has won ? It’s dropped a little in anticipation because he’s leading, but it’s definitely going to drop some more if he actually wins the primary."
Yeah at the very least. Msft is pretty much guaranteed at this point. If visa misses you’ll get robbed of what you already have.
Lmao can this dinosaur of a company just die already.
"FuTuReZ🔮 🩸🚨🆘🛑♨️💔🩸

I guess after admitting to QE &amp; indefinite REPO, hedge funds are dumping &amp; tanking the market as the buy 🍑💨

They know Jerome stuck his 🦶 down The Fed’s throat &amp; they have to buy 🆙 the market no matter what 

🐋🐳cum 🔙 ♈️olatility🎢"
"Ok that makes sense.  The tactical bears that don’t hold for long are printing.

While the retards like me are holding for too long.  I guess I should clarify “I feel like I’m one of the few retarded traders left alive that’s betting against the market” as eventually I will run out of play $$$."

"Good work, carry in"
"I still absolutely think this will crash. I’m not willing to put my life savings on it, but it is inevitable. They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."
People have said it’s a bubble for 4-5 years. People said TSLA was a bubble at $350. AMD was a bubble at $35. I could go on.
"Nah, I am too.  Been having to cover overnight the last couple of days and through earnings.  The premium collection has helped keep things afloat."

"You know I always think people who do this are idiots. But I always think they are good damn prodigy geniuses when they hit it big.

I hope you hit it big my friend lol."
"No... you would lose to inflation just like cash and actually perform worse than cash for awhile because your returns will be negative and inflation is rising.

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."
"Sorry but, it's looking like msft will open red tbh

-1% on the indices will make msft open slightly down from it's 4pm close

"There's really no way you could have lost money on tesla. Yesterday, Elon tweeted a chair emoji. This indicates that earnings are something the shorts should have a seat for before viewing. Then, chairs are made of wood. As in the bulls will be hard as wood. Finally, the shorts will use the chair to leverage their action of performing $ROPE. The easiest $"
what the fuck no
"Lmao what are you smoking? Since when is -0.14 “blood fucking red almost at the point of no recovery”? Were you around when we recovered from -1.50% earlier this month? 

It’s probably a red day tmrw but FUCK no MSFT is not opening at 167. It’s opening at 170+"

"yeah I guess the take away is that gold is a pseudo counter indicator, but there are a lot of factors 

If gold dips AND the economy dips, I think history would suggest buying the gold dip could be quite lucrative at that time while playing gold in anticipation of a crash may be less profitable"
"Options are a little bit murky in terms of how they're explained on common investment websites, but I find [this collection of strategies](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/) to be pretty comprehensive, and if their are holes to be filled a quick google search usually reveals them.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.
Whew... that's a lot of holding. Best of luck to you on the spce calls. I did puts on it a few days ago cashed out at 32% up. But my FB calls today really hurt. Time heals all wounds they say. 🤪

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

1. Peeps told me JNUG has a high premium. I see .8%. Is this the same as any ETF, and its 0.8% annually? Or does the fact its a nightly reset mean that you're paying that ...daily?
2. A pandemic would cause recession and therefore be good for gold, right? How did gold do in 2008?"

Not only does the Cybertruck have a much larger lockable internal bed volume than the F-150, but it also has a frunk compartment and two huge 6 foot long side sail panels for tools. 

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."

"There's really no way you could have lost money on tesla. Yesterday, Elon tweeted a chair emoji. This indicates that earnings are something the shorts should have a seat for before viewing.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They’re promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there’s no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that’s 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I’m gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It’s literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it’s also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily.
