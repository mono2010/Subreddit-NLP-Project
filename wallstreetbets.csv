Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"No shit that's what smart &amp; dumb money is, retard, but that's not what the argument is and you know it.  That's why you're fucking dodging it.

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."
You know what - there are hundreds of trades that do this all the time and I always wondered what happens

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

They already guided on the call that there is a mandatory 1.5 week shutdown at the gigafactory in Shanghai. They‚Äôre promising 500,000 vehicle deliveries in 2020. But you know there‚Äôs no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that‚Äôs 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises. Past performance does not ensure future performance. You guys can do what you want, but I‚Äôm gonna be buying cheap puts every week because when this house of cards falls it will pay for those  accumulated FDs and then some."

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it. The flu kills hundreds of thousands a year. I'm not saying we shouldn't stop/lower efforts to contain the coronavirus but to think that failure to do so would lead to the apocalypse is just misinformed

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Only one of the patients have a fever, while the other two are not showing any symptoms. They are currently quarantined in Tokyo.

So about a 1% infection rate. Yikes. Assuming similar numbers, rough math shows a potential 100,000+ cases in Wuhan alone. Potentially one million + in all of China. Not sure how the Chinese are planning to contain this."

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now.

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that‚Äôs 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"No shit that's what smart &amp; dumb money is, retard, but that's not what the argument is and you know it.  That's why you're fucking dodging it.

You know how someone can tell you don't have shit left to say?  It's when you're left with only playing semantics, even though the entire point of this argument we're having is about PDT.  But you know PDT is bullshit and that's why you'd never want to fall under it yourself, and that's why you're avoiding the whole argument.  What's the matter?  You can't trade for shit without an unfair advantage?  You hoping to one day afford your own bailout status?  Pathetic."
You know what - there are hundreds of trades that do this all the time and I always wondered what happens

"Ok. Second question. Gold sucked in 2008 because everyone wanted to hold cash, got it. But IF there is a pandemic (plz serious responses assuming this hypothetical), and it forces us into recession, isnt' that different from a bank collapse? A recession would be met by further stimulus...both of which drive gold up, right? The basic point i'm pushing here is that lehman collapse 2008 =/= pandemic where a few million people die. 

I feel like gold would do well in a pandemic environment, but i'm not sure...?"

But you know there‚Äôs no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that‚Äôs 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it‚Äôs also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily.

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it.

On top of that it‚Äôs also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It‚Äôs literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

But you know there‚Äôs no more rebates from the government for electric cars, right? And what if the coronavirus causes a shutdown that‚Äôs 2.5 weeks, or a month, until things really get back to normal? The value of the company is right now based SOLELY on promises.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Yes? For 2020 that is. 2021 will be Disney's version of Apple's 2020. 

Walt Disney World 50th (will drive ticket sales by at least 20%). 7 new rides opening. 

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars. 

Plus there's a good chance Disney secures the NFL Sunday Ticket from AT&amp;T this year for 2021."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Not only does the Cybertruck have a much larger lockable internal bed volume than the F-150, but it also has a frunk compartment and two huge 6 foot long side sail panels for tools. 

On top of that it‚Äôs also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It‚Äôs literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

"Gold got its ass kicked between September 2008-December 2008.  I know because I owned gold then and it was a bit shocking.  Think it got to $600 or so per ounce.

An initial sell off of gold would make sense but then a slow/steady rise over a 12-24 month period to $2k per ounce is likely.  So says my gold dealer anyway."

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Low bar for YoY Disney Plus growth (with a full year of Europe). Plus a ton of new content flowing on the service (they have nothing except The Mandalorian) now. 

Low bar for box office growth (I think they strategically made 2020 a shitty year for movie releases since they nutted in 2019 with MCU, Frozen, Lion King and even Star Wars.

"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

On top of that it‚Äôs also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It‚Äôs literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

From what i understand- gold is valuable in it's ability to maintain value but it's already been in for quite a run. It's scarcity will prevent it from ever becoming an actually currency again.
Whew... that's a lot of holding. Best of luck to you on the spce calls. I did puts on it a few days ago cashed out at 32% up. But my FB calls today really hurt. Time heals all wounds they say. ü§™

"News flash: PDT doesn't measure investor type by institution/retail like you do.  They measure by $.  Some autist can easily get more than $25k in student loans to get around it.  So does your lovely PDT stop him then?  No, you fucking retard.

Better yet, just extend PDT to all accounts.  The institutions are the only ones getting bailouts from their fuck ups anyway.  Oh, what's that?  What's wrong?  You don't like being ""protected""?  L...O...L stupid fuck"
"Ok. So you don't exercise it..

In the beginning, OP took a $4 gamble that Tesla would hit 800 bucks IIRC. Now, his gamble is worth more because the price shot up real fast and it looked slightly possible that it could happen, or at least his gamble could be more valuable to another person that feels like taking that bet.

You could buy a cheap option for 10 bucks, the price of the actual stock may rise 20 cents, and turn around and sell your option to someone else for a good profit. Also, remember that your option depreciates the closer you get to your expiration, as there is less time for your stock price to meet the strike.

Also, Google Options Calculators.. They'll kinda help you understand all the possibilities before you buy an option. I started off real cheap and just learned as I went.. So far, so good."

Now you should get a pass on this one if you‚Äôre under 9 yrs old. Right?
Because the flu is already widespread and is no longer possible to contain/eradicate. If the flu was just discovered the government would do everything it does now to prevent it. The flu kills hundreds of thousands a year. I'm not saying we shouldn't stop/lower efforts to contain the coronavirus but to think that failure to do so would lead to the apocalypse is just misinformed

1. Peeps told me JNUG has a high premium. I see .8%. Is this the same as any ETF, and its 0.8% annually? Or does the fact its a nightly reset mean that you're paying that ...daily?
2. A pandemic would cause recession and therefore be good for gold, right? How did gold do in 2008?"
"&gt;I bought the calls yesterday mid day because it looked like a good entry

What part of ATH and up 50% in 3 months made it a good entry point lol"

"Ughhhhh who told you the Cybertruck can‚Äôt hold toolboxes?

Not only does the Cybertruck have a much larger lockable internal bed volume than the F-150, but it also has a frunk compartment and two huge 6 foot long side sail panels for tools. 

On top of that it‚Äôs also got high power electric hookups and a built in air compressor for power tools, and a built in ramp for easily getting large objects and tools in and out of the bed easily. 

It‚Äôs literally a construction persons dream. If you think that most people will buy an F-150 electric truck just because Ford makes a good gas F-150 then you might be in for a surprise. Most people care much more about, specs, range, utility, and most importantly price."

"Yeah I just see more downside than upside as well, also easy for companies to keep beating ER when they lowered guidance like 3-4 Qs in a row and everything floats up with the market regardless.
